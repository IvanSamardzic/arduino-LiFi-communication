### About Li-Fi
LiFi communication system sends and receives the data at high speeds over the visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared spectrums. System is made using Arduino Due microcontroller and 
small amount of analog electronics like operational amplifiers, capacitors, resistors, IR LED and photodiode.

In terms of its end use, the technology is similar to Wi-Fi -- the key technical difference being that Wi-Fi uses radio frequency to induce a voltage in an antenna to transmit data. 
Whereas Li-Fi uses the modulation of light intensity to transmit data. Li-Fi can theoretically transmit at speeds of up to 100 Gbit/s. Li-Fi's ability to safely function in areas 
otherwise susceptible to electromagnetic interference (e.g. aircraft cabins, hospitals, military) is an advantage.[3] The technology is being developed by several organizations across
the globe.
